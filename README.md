# Didactic Chainsaw
###### Thanks for the name, github random name generator

## To build from source:
Note: All commands are for linux. If your OS is anything else, I'm sure you can figure something out.
### Walkthrough
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Ban1p7/didactic-chainsaw.git` or click on green "code" button and download the zip, then `unzip didactic-chainsaw-main.zip`
2. Enter the new folder -- `cd didactic-chainsaw` (or `cd didactic-chainsaw-main` if you downloaded the .zip)
3. Make a build folder and enter it -- `mkdir build && cd build` (You can call it whatever, not just "build")
4. Generate the makefiles -- `cmake ..`
5. Compile the program -- `make`
6. Run it! `./DidacticChainsaw`

### Just copy and paste the commands
Therefore, with git:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ban1p7/didactic-chainsaw.git
cd didactic-chainsaw
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./DidacticChainsaw
```
Or if downloading the zip, navigate to it in your terminal and:
```
unzip didactic-chainsaw-main.zip
cd didactic-chainsaw-main
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./DidacticChainsaw
```
